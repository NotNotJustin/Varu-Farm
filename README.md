# Varu-Farm
A farm for VaruBot on Discord. Be sure to do this on a server that is not open for the public, aka Server Discoverabilty. This could get you banned from public servers if you do this on there.

# FAQ:

## Q: How do I use this program?
1. Ensure you are not on a public server. Best way to do this is to create a new server and setup VaruBot as you normally would.
2. Set the prefix of VaruBot to `v!`. You can do this by running this command: `!varubot prefix v!`
3. Next, make sure you have the latest version of Varu-Farm by going to the Releases section of the `master` branch.
4. After you have downloaded the \*.exe file, double click it in your Downloads directory. You should see an icon appear on the right-hand side of your taskbar. If you do not see it, click the arrow that shows Hidden Icons. If you do see it before or after showing Hidden Icons, you successfully started the program, but you aren't done yet.
5. Click in to Discord and make sure you are in the server and channel where you just set up VaruBot. Click in the message bar at the bottom of the window. Then on your keyboard, press `Ctrl` `Alt` `Q` to run the script. The bot will wait between 2.5 and 12.5 seconds after the 1 minute cooldown on the command has expired, then type out the message near-instantly and send it to that channel.

**Controls List:**
`Ctrl` `Alt` `Q`: Start Script

**CONGRATS! YOU'RE NOW FARMING VARUBOT!**

## Q: What are the risks in using this program?
As with all autofarm programs there's a possibility you may be banned as this script and the code inside it is not officially supported by the developer of the bot or Discord themselves. That's why I strongly encourage you to read the `How do I use this program?` question thoroughly before using this app. There are some helpful tips and all-around good information on there. Also if you do do this in a public server, I am not liable if you get banned from the server or from Discord as a whole. You downloaded this program willingly and freely. Any legal cases or charges against me were waived upon you downloading this program.

## Q: I am the developer of VaruBot and would like this farming script removed. How do I contact the developer of this script?
You may message me on Twitter using an official VaruBot handle or show some proof that you are the developer of the bot. I will talk to you on there and we can make arrangements then. https://twitter.com/_NotNotJustin

If Discord is easier, you can message me using the same Discord account you use for the Varubot's Lair Discord Server. My Discord handle is `NotNotJustin#0330` .
